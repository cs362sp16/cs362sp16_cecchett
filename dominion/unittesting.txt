========== OVERVIEW OF TESTING EFFORTS ==========

Overall, I would say the most challenging part of unit testing the dominion.c functions
was coming up with test cases and mocked data to operate on. Sometimes it wasn't always
obvious what a given function should do under certain circumstances, and so it took some
thought to determine the expected behavior. Additionally, even though I have pretty high
coverage of the functions under test, it doesn't necessarily even mean they are operating
properly. It's nearly impossible to test them under every condition, which means they might
only operate properly under certain assumptions.



==================== COVERAGE ===================

unittest1.c - whoseTurn
* This unit test covers 100% of whoseTurn's lines (which is 1)
* This implies this function is pretty well covered by my unit test.

unittest2.c - handCard
* Thus unit test covers 100% of handCard's lines (which is 2)
* This implies this function is pretty well covered by my unit test.

unittest3.c - fullDeckCount
* This unit test covers 100% of fullDeckCount's lines (which is 11)
* This implies this function is pretty well covered by my unit test.

unittest4.c - updateCoins
* THis unit test covers 100 of updateCoins' lines (which is 14)
* This implies this function is pretty well covered by my unit test.

cardtest1.c - Cutpurse
* Coverage is difficult to measure since this is not a separate function. However, it's 
	coverage is included within the overall statistic.

cardtest2.c - Sea Hag
* Coverage is difficult to measure since this is not a separate function. However, it's 
	coverage is included within the overall statistic.

cardtest3.c - Smithy
* This unit test covers 100% of cardEffectSmithy's lines (which is 5)
* This implies this function is pretty well covered by my unit test.

cardtest4.c - Council Room
* This unit test covers 100% of cardEffectCouncilRoom's lines (which is 11)
* This implies this function is pretty well covered by my unit test.

Overall coverage of dominion.c (all tests combined)
* Lines executed: 30.17% of 643
