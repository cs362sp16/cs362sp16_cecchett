========== OVERVIEW OF TESTING EFFORTS ==========

Overall, I would say the most challenging part of unit testing the dominion.c functions
was coming up with test cases and mocked data to operate on. Sometimes it wasn't always
obvious what a given function should do under certain circumstances, and so it took some
thought to determien the expected behavior.



==================== COVERAGE ===================

unittest1.c - whoseTurn
* This unit test covers 100% of whoseTurn's lines (which is 1)

unittest2.c - handCard
* Thus unit test covers 100% of handCard's lines (which is 2)

unittest3.c - fullDeckCount
* This unit test covers 100% of fullDeckCount's lines (which is 11)

unittest4.c - updateCoins
* THis unit test covers 100 of updateCoins' lines (which is 14)

cardtest1.c - Cutpurse
* Coverage is difficult to measure since this is not a separate function. However, it's 
	coverage is included within the overall statistic.

cardtest2.c - Sea Hag
* Coverage is difficult to measure since this is not a separate function. However, it's 
	coverage is included within the overall statistic.

cardtest3.c - Smithy
* This unit test covers 100% of cardEffectSmithy's lines (which is 5)

cardtest4.c - Council Room
* This unit test covers 100% of cardEffectCouncilRoom's lines (which is 11)
