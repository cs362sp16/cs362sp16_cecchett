================ Comparison ================

I used my diffdominion.py (which runs my testdominion) against both my own
and another random student's version of dominion.c. For the seed of 42, we both
produced the same output. For the seed of 30, however, the test failed. The diff
file makes it difficult to tell exactly what happened here. It indicates that at
a certain point, the two implementations "diverge", with one playing an action
card and one playing a treasure card. This should never be the case if two hands
are identical, which leads me to believe this must be the result of a differing
hand (card effect? bug? who knows).
