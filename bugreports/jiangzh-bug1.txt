Name: Cutpurse - coins not incremented

Severity: Moderate - only part of a card's affect is missing

Priority: Moderate - doesn't break game state, just doesn't do what it's suppsoed to

Description: 
	The cutpurse card effect should increment the user's "coins" attribute by 2.
	It appears that in all cases this is not being updated, and is instead remaining
	unchanged.

Tests to reproduce:
	To reproduce, you can run my randomcardtest1 against your dominion.c using a
	seed value of 42.

	$ make randomtest-build
	$ ./randomtestcard1 42
