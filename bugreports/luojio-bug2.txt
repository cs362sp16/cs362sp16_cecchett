Name: Adventurer - segmentation fault

Severity: High - completely halts the program

Priority: High - could prevent a user from completing a game

Description: 
	It appears that cardEffect is causing a segmentation fault when executing for
	the adventurer card under certain conditions. The exact conditions are still
	unclear to me, but below provides a way to consistently reproduce the issue.

Tests to reproduce:
	To reproduce, you can run my randomtestadventurer against your dominion.c using a
	seed value of 42.
	
	$ make randomtest-build
	$ ./randomtestadventurer 42
