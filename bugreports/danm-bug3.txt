Name: Sea Hag - cards not discarded, curse not added

Description: 
	Sea Hag doesn't seem to be behaving as expected. According to my automated test, the
	following 3 assertions are failing:

	- ASSERTION FAILED: Another player's top deck card was discarded. (One card in deck)
	- ASSERTION FAILED: Another player's top deck card was discarded. (Two cards in deck)
	- ASSERTION FAILED: Another player's top deck card is now curse. (Two cards in deck)

	From this, it appears that the deck-manipulation functions surrounding Sea Hag card 
	must have a bug. Oftentimes, it is not properly discarding/gaining a curse/putting it
	on top of the deck.

Tests to reproduce:
	To reproduce, you can run my cardtest2 against your dominion.c
	
	$ make test-build
	$ ./cardtest2
